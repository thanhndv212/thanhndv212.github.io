## ‚ú® Introduction

As robotic systems grow in complexity, so too does the software that powers them. From simple actuator control to AI-enabled decision-making, a robot‚Äôs software stack spans multiple layers, often distributed across real-time devices, onboard computers, and the cloud.

In this post, we break down the full-stack software architecture of modern robots, examining each layer and how they interconnect. By understanding these layers, roboticists can design systems that are robust, scalable, and capable of handling the challenges of real-world environments.

## üß± What is a Full-Stack Robot Software Architecture?

A **full-stack** in robotics refers to the complete hierarchy of software components required to operate a robot. This includes:

- **Low-level firmware** for hardware control  
- **Middleware** like ROS for modular communication  
- **High-level logic** for planning and decision-making  
- **Perception systems** for sensing the environment  
- **Remote/cloud integration** for remote control and data logging

Each layer plays a critical role in ensuring the robot operates efficiently and effectively. For example, the low-level firmware ensures precise motor control, while the middleware facilitates communication between different components. High-level logic enables the robot to make decisions, and perception systems allow it to understand its surroundings.

## üß© Core Layers of the Stack

### 1. Embedded and Low-Level Control

Responsible for direct interaction with motors, sensors, and actuators:

- Real-time firmware (e.g., running on STM32, TI C2000)
- RTOS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr)
- Motor drivers, encoder interfaces, ADCs, PWM generation
- Control loops (current, velocity, position)

Low-level control is the foundation of any robotic system. It ensures that the robot's actuators respond accurately to commands, providing the necessary precision for tasks like manipulation or locomotion. Real-time operating systems (RTOS) are often used to meet the stringent timing requirements of these systems.

> Example tools:
> - [SimpleFOC](https://docs.simplefoc.com/): A library for field-oriented control of motors.
> - [micro-ROS](https://micro.ros.org/): Extends ROS 2 to microcontrollers.
> - [ChibiOS](http://www.chibios.org/): A lightweight RTOS for embedded systems.

### 2. Middleware Layer (e.g. ROS)

This layer abstracts hardware and provides standardized messaging and control frameworks.

- **ROS 1 / ROS 2**
    - `ros_control`, `hardware_interface`
    - Real-time node execution
- **DDS-based messaging (ROS 2)**
- Topic-based communication, services, actions
- Parameter server, TF transforms

Middleware like ROS acts as the glue that connects different parts of the robot's software stack. It provides a modular framework that allows developers to focus on specific components without worrying about the underlying communication protocols.

> Key middleware choices:
> - [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/index.html): The latest version of ROS, designed for real-time and distributed systems.
> - [LCM](https://lcm-proj.github.io/): A lightweight communication library for robotics.

<!-- ```bash
# Example: Launching ROS 2 node
ros2 run my_robot_driver driver_node
``` -->

---

### 3. Behavior and Task-Level Planning

Defines what the robot should do, not just how.

- **Behavior Trees**: A flexible way to define complex behaviors.
- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**: Useful for tasks with well-defined states.
- **Task planners** (e.g., BT++, FlexBE, SMACH): Enable high-level task sequencing.

Behavior and task-level planning are essential for robots that need to perform complex, multi-step tasks. For example, a warehouse robot might need to pick up an item, navigate to a specific location, and place the item on a shelf.

> Example: ‚ÄúPick object, move to location, place object‚Äù becomes a sequenced state machine or behavior tree.

### 4. Perception and Semantic Understanding

Processes sensor input to form a world model:

- Sensor fusion (IMU + LIDAR + camera)
- Object detection (YOLO, Detectron2)
- Semantic SLAM
- Scene graphs and semantic maps

Perception is the robot's way of understanding its environment. By combining data from multiple sensors, the robot can build a detailed map of its surroundings, identify objects, and plan its actions accordingly.

> - [MoveIt Perception](https://moveit.ros.org/): Integrates perception with motion planning. -->

### 5. Cloud/Edge Integration

Enables remote supervision, data logging, and cloud-based AI inference.

- MQTT, WebSockets, DDS over 5G
- Digital twins (e.g., NVIDIA Omniverse)
- Remote dashboards (Grafana, ROSBridge)
- Off-board training/inference pipelines

Cloud and edge integration allow robots to leverage powerful computational resources that may not be available onboard. This is particularly useful for tasks like training machine learning models or running computationally intensive simulations.

> Examples:
> - [AWS RoboMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/robomaker/): A cloud-based robotics development environment.
> - [Azure Percept](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-percept/): A platform for edge AI.

## üîå Communication and Synchronization

Robots often require multi-process or multi-device orchestration:

- Time synchronization (NTP, PTP)
- DDS QoS policies (latency, reliability)
- Real-time vs non-real-time separation

Effective communication and synchronization are critical for ensuring that all parts of the robot work together seamlessly. This is especially important in distributed systems where components may be running on different devices.

| Protocol       | Purpose                  | Used In            |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| DDS            | ROS 2 middleware        | ROS 2              |
| CAN            | Motor driver buses      | Low-level          |
| Ethernet/IP    | High-speed sensors      | Mid-level          |
| MQTT/WebRTC    | Cloud integration       | High-level         |
