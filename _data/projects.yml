- title: "FIGAROH+: A open-sourse python toolbox for robotic system identification"
  description: "This toolbox provides a set of tools for system identification of robotic systems, including data collection, model fitting, and validation. It covers a wide range of robotic systems, including manipulators, mobile robots, and humanoids. Currently, it supports the following models: dynamic model (including joint friction, actuator inertia), kinematic model (including gear backlash, joint elasticity). It also provides various examples of system identification using external measurement sensors (camera, mocap), or even without any external sensors. The toolbox is designed to be easy to use and extend, making it suitable for both researchers and practitioners in the field of robotics.",
