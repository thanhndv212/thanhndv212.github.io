# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am interested in robotics, particularly in the field of modeling, system ID, model related applications.

  I obtained a Ph.D in Dec, 2024 at [LAAS-CNRS](https://www.laas.fr/en/home), where I was advised by
  [Florent Lamiraux](https://florent.lamiraux@laas.fr/) and [Vincent Bonnet](vincent.bonnet@laas.fr).

  I occasionally write about my research and other topics on this blog.
